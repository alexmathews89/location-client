This project serves as the client side of a demo application that uses the MERN tech stack. The application itself allows a user to create an account and login to view information about different parts of the city of Seattle. It also gives the user the ability to add these locations to a list of favorites, update their user information and delete their account.

PS: this is a demo application and when creating an account to view its contents, you do not have to use your actual information. For example, when the signup page asks you for your email address, you can use dummy information such as email@email.com. The same goes for birthday, username and password. You do not have to use real and verifiable information(such as a real email address or birthday) to create an account to view the app’s contents.
